[fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)) is a program from BSD that picks a random message from a database. 

This project's contribution is a database for Geeks.

Some use it in combination with `cowsay`.

```bash
tan@omega  ~/development/projects  fortune | cowsay

                ||     ||
```


Example `cowsay` as `tux`.

```bash
