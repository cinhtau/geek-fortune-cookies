## About fortune

[fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)) is a program from BSD that picks a random message from a database. 

This projects contribution is a database for Geeks.

Some use it in combination with `cowsay`.

```bash
tan@omega  ~/development/projects  fortune | cowsay

                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```


Example `cowsay` as `tux`.

```bash
 tan@omega  ~/development/projects  fortune | cowsay -f tux

    52.50% fortunes
    31.91% literature
```

The database will be named after the sources.

### Sources

* Programming Wisdom (Twitter Account)
* I Am Devloper (Twitter Account)

### Data

Find first examples in the fortune directory. In order to use the fortune databases, create a random access file for storing strings with `strfile`.

```bash
for db in databases/*; do strfile $db;done  
```

Output
```text
"databases/i-am-developer.dat" created
There was 1 string
Longest string: 91 bytes
Shortest string: 91 bytes
"databases/i-am-developer.dat.dat" created
There was 1 string
Longest string: 32 bytes
Shortest string: 32 bytes
"databases/programming-wisdom.dat" created
There were 2 strings
Longest string: 123 bytes
Shortest string: 114 bytes
"databases/programming-wisdom.dat.dat" created
There was 1 string
Longest string: 36 bytes
Shortest string: 36 bytes
```

### Format

* Each entry starts with `%`
* Each entry must end with a newline.

### Usage

To use fortune with the databases, we pass the directory.

```bash
fortune databases
We build our computers the way we build our cities:
   over time, without a plan, on top of ruins.
        -- Ellen Ullman
```

Use it with `cowsay`

```
fortune databases | cowsay
