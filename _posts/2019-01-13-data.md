## Data

Find first examples in the fortune [databases directory](./databases). In order to use the fortune databases, 
create a random access file for storing strings with `strfile`.

```bash
for db in databases/*;do strfile $db;done  
```

### Format

* Each entry starts with `%`
* Each entry must end with a newline.

### Usage

To use fortune with the databases, we pass the directory.

```bash
fortune databases
We build our computers the way we build our cities:
   over time, without a plan, on top of ruins.
        -- Ellen Ullman
```

Use it with `cowsay`

```
fortune databases | cowsay
