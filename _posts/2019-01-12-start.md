My motivation for this project is a customiziation of my `zsh`.

Every time I login I want to see the current weather of my location and fortune cookie.

I am dissatified with the existing content. 

Most of time I read the Twitter tweets from

- [Programming Wisdom](https://twitter.com/CodeWisdom)
- [I Am Developer](https://twitter.com/iamdevloper)

So my idea is to extract the tweets from Twitter and output it as [`fortune`](https://www.unix.com/man-page/freebsd/6/fortune/) 
compatible databases for my daily use.
