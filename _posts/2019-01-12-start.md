## The fun has started

My motivation for this project is a customisation of my `zsh`.

Every time I login I want to see the current weather of my location and fortune cookie.

Example: zsh Dark

Example: zsh Light

## Problem 

I am dissatisfied with the existing content. 

## Solution

Most of time I read the Twitter tweets from

- [Programming Wisdom](https://twitter.com/CodeWisdom)
- [I Am Developer](https://twitter.com/iamdevloper)

For instance:

![I Am Developer Tweet](https://cinhtau.github.io/geek-fortune-cookies/assets/images/code_review.png)

So my idea is to extract the tweets from Twitter and output it as [`fortune`](https://www.unix.com/man-page/freebsd/6/fortune/) 
compatible databases for my daily use.
